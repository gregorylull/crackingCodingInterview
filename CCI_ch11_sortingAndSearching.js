Common Sorting Algorithms

  Bubble Sort
    Runtime: O (n^2) average and worse case. 
    Memory: O(1)

    swap first two elements if first is greater than second, go to next pair, so on. 
    iterate through array again

  Selection Sort
    Runtime: O(n^2) average and worst case.
    Memory: O(1).

    find the smallest element, and swap with the front element...
    find the second smallest, and swap with the second element...
    so on

  Merge Sort
    Runtime: O(n Log(n)) average and worse case.
    Memory: Depends

    divides array in half, sort each half, then merge together.
    same divide/sort/merge logic is applied to each half.
    MERGE part does heavy lifting


Searching Algorithms

  Binary Search 
    Runtime: O(n Log(n))
    Memory: Depends

    input array has to be sorted!
